# My Atreus Keyboard layout

This is where I save my latest [Chrysalis](https://github.com/keyboardio/Chrysalis) Export for my Atreus keyboard from [https://shop.keyboard.io/](https://shop.keyboard.io/).

I have set it up for Mac and its taken me a fair amount of playing to get it set in a way that I remember where most things are on a regular basis with the occasional having to remember where the [] and {} are.

Please Enjoy and any questions please let me know.
 

### Layer 0 - Basic typing and regular used punctuation. Layer Shifts are under my right thumb, for punctuation, numbers and mouse/cursor with another under left pinky for Hyperkey.

### Layer 3 - (Whilst holding Space) Mouse on left and cursor, media and related on right. Notice the extra : so I can type it with shift when on Layer 1 for entering times.

### Layer 4 - (Whilst holding Esc) My Hyperkey layer. Key & Cmd + Alt + Ctrl + Shift. I use Alfred and BetterTouchTool to trigger automations based off these. I only fill the keys in when I add something.
